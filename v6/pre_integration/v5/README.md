# Phase 6 part 5
(zips coming soon)

## **Updates in this version**
- Toggle for the two versions (anime/games)
- For anime gen, options to generate based on favorite shows/characters on MAL profile
- Tiled approach to show multiple images (with toggle for any of the characters/titles the user doesn't want to see)
- Smooth transition when elements are toggled off

## **Challenges for post-integration (if possible)**
- Implementation for other types of profiles
    - Generate 10 recently played games based on steam profile
