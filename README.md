# Changing my Firefox new tab

Phase 1: Basic Random Background on New Tab

    Every time you open a new tab, a random image is selected from a folder or list.
    This can be done with CSS + JavaScript inside an extension.

Phase 2: Background Rotation (Auto-Switch Every 10s)

    Background image changes every 10 seconds.
    Optimization (2b): Only change if the tab is open (so it doesn't kill RAM).

Phase 3: Adding in top-sites

    Features top sites as commonly seen on firefox, but styled differently.

Phase 4: Choice of websites

    Choose between custom presets for quick access, or add your own
    Quick access will be entertainment-focused or productivity-focused
    Will feature a button to choose which preset

Phase 5: Hopecore Integration

    On new tab load, generate a hopecore image + quote.
    (3b): Button to manually generate a new hopecore.
    (3c): Auto-regenerate hopecore every 10 seconds.

Phase 6: Deep Personalization (MAL & Game Data)

    (4a): Fetch recent anime from MAL profile and use images from most recently watched shows.
    (4b): Link different platforms (MAL, Steam, etc.), adding a button to choose between recently played games or anime.
    (4c): Select from the most recent 3-5 anime/games (toggle buttons).
    (4d): Automatically rotate between all images (recent anime, games, hopecore, etc.).
