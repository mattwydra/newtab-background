# Phase 4a

## Overview
This project is a custom new tab page that features:
- A search bar for quick searches.
- A set of predefined top sites.
- Category buttons to switch between different site categories (Productivity, Gaming, Media, and Custom).
- A dynamic background that changes every 10 seconds.

## Features
- **Search Bar**: Quickly search the web.
- **Predefined Top Sites**: Commonly used websites are displayed.
- **Category Buttons**: Click a button to switch between site groups.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Background changes every 10 seconds.

## How It Works
1. The script initializes with predefined sites and categories.
2. Clicking a category button updates the displayed sites.
3. Users can add custom sites, which are saved in `localStorage`.
4. Background images change periodically.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Future Improvements
- Support for user-defined categories.
- More customization options for backgrounds.
