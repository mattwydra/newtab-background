# Phase 6 part 2
(zips coming soon)

## **Updates in this version**
- Generates 10 recently watched anime
- Buttons are in English, text in Romaji to cover bases
- Overcomes rate-limitations

## **Challenges for next version**
- Elements need to be styled better
   - Hard to read text, buttons take up a lot of space
   - Should Implement button to hide all buttons on the screen
   
## **Further Implementation**
- Entering a specific anime for the background
- Entering a specific character for the background
- Tiled approach to show multiple images (with toggle for any of the characters/titles the user doesn't want to see)
